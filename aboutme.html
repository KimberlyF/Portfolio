<h4><u>7/17/17 Reflection</u></h4>
  <p>-My idea of robotics did not change at all, as I was always interested in robotics. What makes me excited about the future of robotics is all the technological advancements that make living easier, but also more fun. What makes me nervous is that these advancements also have negative effects such as having some people being too dependent on the new robotics. </p>
  <p>-When I worked in a group, I felt that the fact that each person in the group knew how to do a part of the project helped at lot. We could've worked together better for the next project.
